Jerry: You ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves? I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out his future. Jerry: Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them? George: When you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're busy. Jerry: I think he re-gifted and then he de-gifted and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Superbowl sex romp. Elaine: You know, it's not fair people are seated first-come-first-served. It should be based on who's hungriest. George: If it wasn't for the toilet, there would be no books. Kramer: Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. ... The end of the show they hold it up to the camera, 'Well, here it is. You can't have any. Thanks for watching. Goodbye. . Newman: It's so great to see a show that's about something. George: Only I could fail at failing. Jackie Chiles: It's lewd, lascivious, salacious, outrageous. Elaine: Is this going to hurt? Doctor: Yes, very much.

Estelle Costanza: You're not giving away our waterpik! Kramer: Eight hours of jingle-belling and ho-ho-hoing. Boy, I am ho'd out! Jerry: Men don't care what's on TV. They only care what else is on TV. Jerry: You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist, don't you? Newer magazines. Newman: Hawaii... The most sought-after postal route of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to lick the stamps? Alton: We had a funny guy with us in Korea. A tailgunner. They blew his brains out all over the Pacific. There’s nothing funny about that. George: Hey, I am not a prude, sweetheart. I swing with the best of them. Jerry: Vandelay Industries, Kel Varnsen speaking. May we help you. Kramer: Hey, you know what would make a great coffee table book? A coffee table book about coffee tables.

Elaine: Snapple? Babu's Brother: No, too fruity. Auctioneer: Ten thousand to the... shapely woman on the left. Jerry: Maybe your yogurt isn't so non-fat. Kramer: Oh, guess again, tubby! Puddy: You got a question, you ask the 8-Ball. Jerry: A two-year old is kind of like having a blender, but you don’t have a top for it. Jerry: It pains me to say this, but I may be getting too mature for details. Jerry: You know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.
