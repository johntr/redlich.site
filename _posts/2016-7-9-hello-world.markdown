I am planning on starting a small blog. I want to post tips and tutorials as I find content is missing or out of date on the web. As I learn new things if I come up with a good way to 
explain something I might post about that too. I currently do a lot of [PHP](http://php.net/) development focusing on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) but I am also learning Javascript focusing on [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/). I am looking for a good front 
end Javascript framework to learn. I am considering [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) or [React](http://reactjs.net/) at the moment but still not sure.  

I hope to be able to come up with content every month or so but I have never done this before I prefer twitter. Follow me for if you would like to hear from me more often.
